## About

ProxPanel is a **personal, independent project** designed to provide a cleaner and more centralized way to monitor and operate Proxmox VE environments from a responsive web interface.

The project is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Proxmox**.

Development is **AI-assisted** for parts of design, code generation, refactoring, documentation and testing. Project direction, review and release decisions remain under the maintainer's control.

## Highlights

- Responsive dashboard for Proxmox VE nodes, VMs and LXCs
- Customizable Dashboard Studio
- TV mode with Summary, Analytics and Studio layouts
- CPU, RAM, storage, network and historical metrics
- QEMU Guest Agent storage visibility for Windows/Linux VMs
- Multi-node infrastructure views and expanded monitoring
- Node CPU temperature collection through `lm-sensors`
- VM/LXC operations and administration workflows
- Backup and task visibility
- Stable / Beta OTA update channels
- Scheduled automatic ProxPanel updates
- Proxmox update checks and notifications
- Panel, Discord and e-mail notifications
- Microsoft 365 Graph / SMTP support
- TOTP 2FA, recovery codes and e-mail fallback
- Persistent installation identity with privacy-minimal OTA heartbeat
- PWA support
- French / English interface
- Docker deployment (multi-architecture image for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` — Raspberry Pi)

## Screenshots

Current screenshots can be added under [`docs/screenshots`](docs/screenshots/README.md). Before publishing a screenshot, make sure it does not expose private hostnames, IP addresses, e-mail addresses or other infrastructure details.

## Quick start with Docker

```bash
docker volume create proxpanel_data
docker volume create proxpanel_runtime

docker run -d \
  --name proxpanel \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v proxpanel_data:/app/data \
  -v proxpanel_runtime:/opt/proxpanel-runtime \
mounik/proxpanel:beta
```

Open:

```text
http://YOUR-SERVER-IP:8080
```

At first launch, ProxPanel asks you to create the first administrator account and then add your Proxmox VE server or cluster.

## Docker Compose

```bash
mkdir proxpanel && cd proxpanel
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mounik/proxpanelPi/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

Or clone this repository and run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Persistent data is stored in Docker volumes and survives container recreation.

## Requirements

For the core application:

- Docker / Docker Compose
- Access from ProxPanel to the Proxmox VE API

For node temperature monitoring:

- `lm-sensors` installed on the monitored Proxmox node
- a Proxmox `@pam` account with a stored password
- SSH access from the ProxPanel container to the node

The official Docker image includes the SSH client and `sshpass` required by the temperature collector.

## Updates

ProxPanel supports two independent OTA channels:

- **Stable** — recommended releases for normal use
- **Beta** — early access to new features; can also move forward to a newer stable release

The selected channel is persistent and is not inferred from the currently installed version. ProxPanel also prevents automatic downgrades.

Official OTA service:

`https://updates.proxpanel.fr`

OTA packages include a `release.json` manifest and are validated before installation.

## Privacy of OTA heartbeat

The OTA service receives only:

```json
{
  "installation_id": "persistent-local-uuid",
  "version": "1.7.2-beta.5",
  "update_channel": "beta"
}
```

ProxPanel does **not** send Proxmox IP addresses, hostnames, VM/LXC inventory, API tokens, user accounts or infrastructure data to the OTA service.

## Persistent data and secrets

Runtime configuration belongs in `/app/data` and the OTA runtime in `/opt/proxpanel-runtime`.

Do not commit:

- `.env`
- `data/`
- `runtime/`
- `settings.json`
- `servers.json`
- `users.json`
- API tokens, passwords, webhooks or private keys

The repository includes `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` rules for these paths.

## Build locally

```bash
docker build -t proxpanel:local .
```

Run it with persistent volumes:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name proxpanel-local \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v proxpanel_data:/app/data \
  -v proxpanel_runtime:/opt/proxpanel-runtime \
  proxpanel:local
```

## Raspberry Pi & architectures

The published image is multi-architecture and runs on `linux/amd64`
(x86_64 servers) and `linux/arm64` (Raspberry Pi 3/4/5 and other ARM
single-board computers). On a Raspberry Pi, Docker automatically pulls
the `arm64` variant, so the `docker run` or `docker compose up -d`
commands above work unchanged.

Tested on **Raspberry Pi 5** (Raspberry Pi OS server, 64-bit) with the published `arm64` variant.

Verify the currently published image supports both architectures:

```bash
docker buildx imagetools inspect mounik/proxpanel:beta
```

The provided publishing script targets `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`:

```bash
DOCKERHUB_IMAGE=mounik/proxpanel ./docker-publish.sh
```

## Security

ProxPanel is an open-source project primarily intended for **HomeLab environments** and controlled administration networks.

The administration interface is **not designed to be exposed directly to the Internet**. For remote access, using a **VPN**, a **private network**, or another secure access mechanism is recommended.

**Multi-factor authentication (2FA/MFA)** should be enabled whenever possible.

The software is provided **without warranty**, in accordance with the **MIT License**.

See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting and [`SECURITY-IMAGE.md`](SECURITY-IMAGE.md) for Docker image hardening notes.

Never post credentials, Proxmox tokens, Microsoft 365 secrets, Discord webhooks or private infrastructure details in a public GitHub issue.

## Contributing

Bug reports, focused feature requests and reviewed pull requests are welcome. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Version history & releases

The public history of the 1.7 branch is available in [`HISTORY.md`](HISTORY.md).

Historical notes are available from **1.7.0-beta.1** onward. **v1.7.0-beta.14** is the first reproducible GitHub Release. The latest published prerelease is **v1.7.2-beta.5**, with full ZIP, OTA ZIP, `release.json` and SHA-256 checksums.

Docker images remain distributed through [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mounik/proxpanel), while `updates.proxpanel.fr` remains responsible for OTA channels, rollout and revocation.

## 1.7.2 roadmap

**1.7.2-beta.5 is the active release in this series.** Docker through Portainer now includes an Images & Updates center with inventory, digest checks, manual pulls, pre-redeploy preview, health verification, history and explicit scheduling disabled by default.


The active **1.7.2-beta.x** series focuses on multi-platform HomeLab operations:

- **Portainer / Docker** as the first officially supported external integration; **Portainer CE is tested first and Business Edition remains compatible when the APIs used are identical**;
- Docker environments, containers and stacks;
- Docker monitoring and alerts;
- Proxmox ↔ Docker topology;
- guided image/update management;
- **optional PBS**, only visible when configured;
- Automations 2.0;
- RBAC and Audit 2.0;
- Health Center 2.0.

See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for the beta.1 → beta.10 plan.

## Project status

Latest published development release: **1.7.2-beta.5**

Latest published GitHub Release: **1.7.2-beta.5**

Current development series: **1.7.2-beta.x** — Portainer/Docker, optional PBS, Automations, RBAC/Audit and Health Center. Maximum 10 betas per version series.

Docker Hub remains the container distribution channel; versioned images should use the same ProxPanel release number as the GitHub/OTA release.

ProxPanel is currently a beta personal project. APIs, UI elements and internal implementation details may still change before a stable release.
